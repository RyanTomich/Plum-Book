# Plum-Book
The Plum Book is a recruiting tool. It takes the honor role data available in the newspaper, cleans it, and adds it in a database. This is then presneted
in a treeview wtih options to search, edit, delete, or add to the database. Finally, the honorole data for each student of an incomming class is queried
form the database, and feed through a ranking algroithm that scores each student based on their honor and trend. This is then presned in a sperate treeview
for the user to see the "plums" for that year.
