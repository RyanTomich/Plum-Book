# Plum-Book
The Plum Book is a GUI recruiting tool. It takes the honor roll data available in the newspaper, cleans it, and adds it in a database. This is then presented in a treeview with options to search, edit, delete, or add to the database. Finally, the honor role data for each student of an incoming class is queried from the database, and fed through a ranking algorithm that scores each student based on their honor and trend. This is then presented in a sperate treeview for the user to see the "plums" for that year.
